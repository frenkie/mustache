# Mustache (working title)

Pimp your party with Mustache! Get your friends in front of the camera and
get randomized mustaches and photo frames. Press the big button and voila, an
instant guestbook memory!

## install
An `npm install` should do the trick.
Afterwards do `npm start` or `npm run debug` to run a server on 
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## usage

You can use your mouse to interact with the site or the following keys:
-   A : Mimicks the big red button which has 3 phases: start camera mode, take a snapshot, save it
-   S : Save a snapshot
-   D : Delete a snapshot in camera mode
-   W : Exit camera mode
-   Left arrow : change mustache
-   Right arrow : change frame

No browser feature detection is done, so for now you're save in the latest version of
Chrome.
